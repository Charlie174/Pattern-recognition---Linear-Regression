# Pattern recognition - Linear Regression

\p
This is an assignment under the Pattern Recognition module. Here we can get a better understanding of Linear Regression. With the given skeletal code we can go through them and understand why splitting the collected data as training and testing is very important. we can understand how it is changing the model and the future prediction. With increasing the amount of data how the model can change, is also covered here. When comes to mathematics NaN values have some bad impressions. Those are mentioned there. However, here model complexity and further ML topics are not covered. as it is under the basic linear regression.
